            <h2>What is Neuroscience Alliance?</h2>
            <p1>The mission of Neuroscience Alliance at UCF is to promote awareness, research, and opportunities 
                in neuroscience at UCF. By encouraging professional relations between students and faculty, students 
                will be provided with opportunities and exposure in current research, potential career paths, and provided 
                with advice and information for a future career in neuroscience. These goals shall be achieved through 
                providing meetings and speeches related to neuroscience, potential outreach in the form of shadowing neuroscience 
                related professionals, volunteering at schools, hospitals, or other such facilities, and creating committees involving 
                projects and ideas relevant to neuroscience within any area such as medicine, philosophy, psychology, biotechnology, 
                psychiatry, computer science, chemistry, cognitive science, linguistics, mathematics, engineering, and physics.
