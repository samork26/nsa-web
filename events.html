        <h2>Arnold Palmer Hospital Brain Dissections</h2>
        <p1>
            Join us as we partner with Arnold Palmer Hospital for Children and shadow their Neuropathology Team! 
            Shadow their team as they perform brain dissections and experience lectures on neuropathology. At each 
            General Body Meeting, we offer our members the chance to join, where 3 members are randomly selected to 
            participate in this shadowing opportunity.

        <h2>Society for Neuroscience Annual Conference</h2>
        <p1>
            Each year, we will be traveling to the Annual SfN Conference, which is a congregation of worldwide Neuroscientists,
            Physicians, and experts in the field where cutting-edge research is shared and new ideas in the world of neuroscience 
            are provided. Applications open during the summer to join us and represent Neuroscience Alliance at UCF at Neuroscience's 
            official and largest national conference.

        <h2>Orlando Science Center</h2>
        <p1>
            OSC is a fun-filled day that we host every academic semester, where we present various exhibitions on Neuroscience 
            to educate children and their families. 
        </p1>
        <li>
            Brain Dissections: Volunteer and assist with our live sheep brain dissections, educating attendees on neuroanatomy, 
            and explaining remarkable case studies and fun facts about different anatomical parts of the brain.
        </li>
        <li>
            Dr: Dare's Lab: Conduct neuroscience-related activities for kids, such as our Backyard Brains activity, memory games, 
            building arts & crafts neurons, building take-home brain caps demonstrating important anatomical aspects of the brain, 
            or performing concussion simulations.
        </li>
        <li>
            Tabling: Sparking meaningful conversations with OSC attendees. Interact with everyone of all ages to discuss Neuroscience 
            with them and educate them about NSA's mission. We have even experienced conversations with experts in the field of neuroscience 
            such as Physicians and Neuroscientists, or people who are also concerned with neurodegenerative diseases.
